# Propagator

A prototype implementation of a data transfer system working as a proof of concept of the [Identity Propagation and Assertions](https://github.com/umalabs/identity-propagation-and-assertions) architecture.

## Rationale

Enable access to third-party web APIs using a loosely coupled architecture, as the MTA-to-MTA SMTP transmission does. This architecture will allow innovation in the data exchange space.
