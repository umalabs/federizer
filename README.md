# Propagator

A prototype implementation of a data transfer system working as a proof of concept of the [Identity Propagation and Assertions](https://github.com/umalabs/identity-propagation-and-assertions) architecture.

## Rationale

As businesses extend the usage of their APIs, it is becoming increasingly clear that a microservices security architecture needs to expand beyond traditional enterprise boundaries. This leads us to implement the [Identity Propagation and Assertions](https://github.com/umalabs/identity-propagation-and-assertions) architecture to enable access to third-party web APIs using a loosely coupled microservices that allows transferring artbitrary data accross security domain boundaries.
