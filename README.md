# Federizer

Federizer, a gRPC message transfer agent (MTA), is a prototype implementation of the [Identity Propagation and Assertions](https://github.com/umalabs/identity-propagation-and-assertions) architecture. Federizer uses this architecture to convey the user's security context alongside messages between MTAs. The Federizer communication resembles how the MTA-to-MTA SMTP transmission works. You can send any message, e.g., an order, from the sender to an arbitrary recipient's API; vice-versa, you can receive a message from any sender.

## Motivation

To create a system that will form the backbone of service-to-service interactions, just as email forms the backbone of user-to-user interaction.

## Demo

As a demo, we've created an email-like system where the first-class citizen is not a message but a file.
